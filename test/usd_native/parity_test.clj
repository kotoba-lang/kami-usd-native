(ns usd-native.parity-test
  "Parity gate between `src/usd_native.kotoba` (the semantic authority) and
  `src/usd_native.cljc` (the load path a Clojure/ClojureScript consumer requires).

  Shape follows `kotoba-lang/css` (`css.kotoba-parity-test`), `kotoba-lang/dsl-core`
  and `kotoba-lang/async` (ADR-2608130900), and `kotoba-lang/postfx` (ADR-2608133600):
  the `.kotoba` is compiled here and executed through the reference evaluator in this
  same JVM, so nothing crosses a runtime boundary, and `kotoba-lang/compiler` stays a
  test-only dependency.

  WHY THE .cljc EXISTS AT ALL. `e56fffc2` (2026-07-20) deleted `src/usd_native.cljc`
  and put the `.kotoba` at that path. A `.kotoba` is on no Clojure classpath, so
  `usd-native` stopped being loadable by every runtime this workspace ranks above the
  native path. The `.cljc` restored beside it is the load path; the `.kotoba` remains
  the authority.

  SEMANTICS DECISION: VERBATIM. Every value the guest exports is byte-identical to
  the corresponding value in the pre-migration `.cljc`, so the restored file is the
  pre-migration file unchanged (`e56fffc2^`). Unlike `dsl-core`/`async`, the guest did
  not alter meaning here; this test is what makes \"unchanged\" a checked claim.

  WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM — the divergences, asserted rather than hidden.

  1. `def` vs nullary function. Kotoba has no top-level value bindings, so every
     constant crosses as a nullary export. Value is compared; the binding form is not.

  2. THE GUEST HAS NO VECTORS HERE. `nv-compat-targets` and `supported-formats` are
     Clojure vectors; the migration flattened each into positional scalar exports
     (`nv-compat-target-0/1/2`, `supported-format-0/1/2`), because this guest's ABI
     carries `:string` and not a sequence. The two
     `…-is-exactly-the-positional-guest-exports` tests compare element by element AND
     pin the length, so a fourth element cannot be added to the load path without a
     guest export behind it — but the *sequence itself* has no counterpart to compare
     against, and that is stated here rather than passed over.

  3. `main` is a wasm entry point, not library API, and is not mirrored."
